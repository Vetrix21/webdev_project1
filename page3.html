            <h2>Musical Interests</h2>
            <p>As I mentioned earlier, my main hobby is music. I love listening to, playing, and producing music.</p>
            <h3>Guitar</h3>
            <p>I play electric guitar and electric bass. I've been playing guitar for about 14 years, and bass for about 4. I have a collection of three guitars and two basses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Schecter Demon-7</li>
                <li>ESP LTD M100-II</li>
                <li>PRS SE Tremonti</li>
                <li>Ibanez SR405epbdx</li>
                <li>G&L Tribute L-2500</li>
            </ul>
            <p>[insert pictures of my guitars here]</p>
            <h3>Genres</h3>
            <p>My favorite genre is metal. I've been listening to heavy music since I was two years old, apparently, since my dad says he had to play Black Sabbath for me or else I wouldn't sleep. I think that's a little funny. My favorite albums include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yXHXJOlps">Whitechapel - The Valley</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mbyPhXTupI7ZNTPh1GYk_cIBMMsupQLMk&feature=shared">Sworn In - The Death Card</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kruYq-oAjlzeV_J6xpw-zWJAm0hl-YZME&feature=shared">Termina - Soul Elegy</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://youtu.be/SETDLOzT94M?feature=shared">Deviloof - Devil's Proof</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://youtu.be/0VGuugFXI2g?feature=shared">Bring Me The Horizon - Sempiternal</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>I don't only listen to metal, but it is my main genre. Other genres I like include Rap, Vocaloid, and some pop.</p>
            <p>[insert pics of The Death Card, God-ish, Montero]</p>
            <h3>About my band</h3>
            <p>As I've said before, I play bass in a local metal band - Suncrusher. I joined the band in January of 2023, and played my first show with them at Subterranean in August of 2023.</p>
            <p>[Insert show pictures]</p>
            <p>I manage some of the technical parts of the band as well. We pass our instruments through a rack unit allowing us to direct the audio both to the front of house system, as well as an in-ear system so we can hear each other and a metronome as we play. I manage that unit. It's not difficult per se, but I'm the only one who learned how to.</p>
            <h3>Music Production</h3>
            <p>As a hobby, I also produce music. I don't have many songs out at the moment because I'm a little lazy, but what I can showcase is a video of a competition submission I made early last year. The competition was to make a track using a new plugin being released by the host's company, and while I didn't win, it was fun to write the track and make a video for it.</p>
