            <p>My favorite genre is metal. I've been listening to heavy music since I was two years old, apparently, since my dad says he had to play Black Sabbath for me or else I wouldn't sleep. I think that's a little funny. My favorite albums include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yXHXJOlps">Whitechapel - The Valley</a></li>
                <li><a href="">Sworn In - The Death Card</a></li>
                <li><a href="">Termina - Soul Elegy</a></li>
                <li><a href="">Deviloof - Devil's Proof</a></li>
                <li><a href="">Bring Me The Horizon - Sempiternal</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>As I've said before, I play bass in a local metal band - Suncrusher. I joined the band in January of 2023, and played my first show with them at Subterranean in August of 2023.</p>
