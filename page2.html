            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! If you're reading this, you are likely either one of my classmates, TAs, or the professor of my ITMD-361 class. If so, we may never get the chance to meet, so I will introduce myself here.</p>
            <h3>Basic info:</h3>
            <p>My name is Nathaniel Wagner. I am a second-year Applied Cybersecurity major at IIT, as well s the bass player for Chicago metal band Suncrusher. I was born and raised in Chicago, and graduated from Jones College Prep.</p>
            <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
            <p>My main hobby is music. I love listening to music, and I love playing music. More on the next page, I could yap about my musical interests all day.</p>
            <p>After music, I enjoy spending time building Gunpla - Plastic Gundam models. It's a very time-consuming hobby, and I like to call it my "weekend killer" from how long some of these models can take to build.</p>
            <p>[Insert Sazabi images here]</p>
            <p>I also enjoy muscle cars. My dream car is a Mustang Boss 429, though it'd have to be a project car at this point because of how expensive they are. Aside from that, I have a lego model of Dom Toretto's 1970 Dodge Charger sitting near my Gundams.</p>
            <p>[Insert images of lego charger]</p>
            <p>I don't have any images to put here, but I also enjoy lifting weights and working out. My goal for 2025 is to increase my maxes by at least 20lbs each. My current numbers are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>S:</strong> 225lbs</li>
                <li><strong>B:</strong> 165lbs</li>
